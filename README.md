# Screen with buttons SIGN-IN and REGISTER and 2 more screens

Program opens screen with photo, text and 2 buttons: SIGN-IN and REGISTER.

When you push button SIGN-IN (REGISTER), it prints 'sign-in' ('register') and goes to the next page with button "Go further". When you click "Go further", it goes to the next page with button "Go back" and you can go back to previous page.

You should add folder 'assets' and put there photo carserv.jpg (it is in Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l9UTZ_tl0WCHXFyYq8O7pi1l8FGDl37V?usp=sharing). Algorithm how to add pictures is in 'empty.txt' file in the folder 'assets'.
